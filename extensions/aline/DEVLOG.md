## 2026-06-14 — from-base n=2 (35k): a real kernel-targeting gain over n=1, at a predictive-RMSE cost

The from-base run queued as the TODO below (now marked done). It answers the
basin question and, unlike the fine-tune, finds a **statistically significant**
credit-window effect — the first positive result for `--credit-n > 1`.

**The run.** n=2 warm-started from the base GP-1D ACE checkpoint
(`--base-checkpoint artifacts/gp1d.pt --credit-n 2 --steps 35000`, full recipe:
policy-lr 3e-4, no special warmup, defaults otherwise), recipe-matched to the
existing 35k n=1 (`gp1d_aline_35k.pt`) — which *is* the from-base n=1 baseline,
so the comparison is controlled by construction. Artifact
`artifacts/gp1d_aline_n2_frombase.pt` (+ `.png`).

**Environment caveat (not a code bug): two transient CUDA faults, recovered via
step-checkpoints.** First launch died at step 3101 (`IndexKernel` index-OOB); a
bit-identical relaunch sailed *past* 3101 and died at step 23300
(`ScatterGatherKernel` OOB + `CUBLAS_STATUS_EXECUTION_FAILED`). Different steps,
different kernels, on the identical deterministic trajectory = a flaky GPU
(transient VRAM/compute faults under sustained load), not a logic error — a real
bug recurs at the *same* step. Recovered by resuming from the last
`--ckpt-every 1000` checkpoint (re-passing `--credit-n 2`, which is **not**
restored on resume — silently reverts to myopic otherwise). Tooling lesson:
piping through `tee` swallowed python's non-zero exit on the first crash
(reported "exit 0"), masking the failure; use a direct `> log 2>&1` redirect so
the harness sees the real exit code.

**Result — paired 16k bootstrap (n2_frombase − n1, both 35k, identical
`EVAL_SEED` episodes, only `--credit-n` differs):**

| paired δ (n2_frombase − n1) | Δ | 95% CI | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **kernel contrast** | **+0.028** | [+0.015, +0.041] | **significant** |
| **RMSE@T (ALINE)** | **+0.009** | [+0.007, +0.011] | **significant (n2 worse)** |
| **RMSE gap-to-US** | **+0.008** | [+0.006, +0.011] | **significant (n2 worse)** |
| ℓ contrast | −0.007 | [−0.020, +0.006] | n.s. |
| θ log q margin | +0.003 | [−0.003, +0.010] | n.s. |

(Aggregates: n1 RMSE 0.192 / ℓδ +0.043 / kernelδ +0.124; n2_frombase RMSE 0.201
/ ℓδ +0.035 / kernelδ +0.152. Calibration clean for both, kernel KL 0.005–0.024.)

- **n=2 credit is a targeting-vs-prediction trade.** Anticipatory credit buys a
  significantly higher kernel-targeting contrast (+0.028, ~23% over the +0.12
  base) — the two-query-coordination payoff the knob was built for, since kernel
  identification wants tight local pairs that conflict with coverage. It costs
  predictive RMSE (+0.009) and a wider gap-to-US (+0.008): queries are
  reallocated off coverage toward parameter targeting. ℓ contrast and θ-logq are
  unchanged — consistent with ℓ being coverage-pinned in GP-1D regardless of
  credit; only the kernel goal, which genuinely conflicts with coverage, responds.
- **Basin question, answered (with a confound).** The *fine-tune* n2 vs n1
  showed kernel contrast +0.007 (n.s. — see the entry below); the *from-base* n2
  shows +0.028 (significant). So the credit-window effect surfaces only when
  trained from base, not by nudging the converged n=1 policy. Honest confound:
  from-base also had more budget and full LR (35k @ 3e-4 vs the fine-tune's 10k
  @ 1e-4), so "basin-trapped" and "under-trained" cannot be separated here. But
  the practical lesson is the same either way — **train the credit window from
  base, not as a gentle fine-tune** — and there is **no hard task ceiling** on
  kernel targeting (the standing ceiling hypothesis was wrong for kernel; it
  still holds for ℓ).
- **Caveats.** Magnitudes are small (~0.03 / ~0.01) and this is **one training
  seed** — eval-sampling is nailed (16k bootstrap) but training-seed variance is
  not controlled, so hold the exact numbers loosely. Trust the *contrast* result
  over the RMSE magnitude: across the 512→2048→16k sweep the contrasts were the
  well-behaved (consistent, tightly bounded) statistics while RMSE was
  heavy-tailed and wandered sign.

**Outcome:** **not promoted** — predictive RMSE regresses significantly, which
matters for the served/playground model, so the served checkpoint stays the 35k
n=1 `gp1d_aline.pt`. The from-base n2 is retained as a research artifact,
`gp1d_aline_n2_frombase.pt`. The comparison was run with the now-parameterized
harness `scripts/analyze_n2.py PATH_A PATH_B [LABEL_A LABEL_B]`.

## 2026-06-13 — n=2 credit fine-tune (10k): no material change vs 35k; 512-ep eval shown to be underpowered; default eval → 16k

Ran the n-step knob from the 35k endpoint and checked it properly. The headline
is a **negative result** plus a **methodological correction** that outlives it.

**The run.** Warm-started 10k fine-tune from `artifacts/gp1d_aline_35k.pt`
(`--load-checkpoint` → strict base+policy load, **fresh** optimizers + a fresh
10k cosine cycle; `--warmup-pred-steps` auto-resolves to 0), `--credit-n 2` the
only credit change, `--policy-lr 1e-4 --warmup 500` to be gentle on the
already-plateaued policy, defaults otherwise. ~3.5 h, avg 1.27 s/step; artifact
`artifacts/gp1d_aline_n2.pt` (+ `.png`/`.log`). **No myopic n=1 control**
(deliberately skipped), so nothing here is attributable to the credit window
vs. "10k more steps + LR restart."

**The run's printed 512-episode diagnostic looked like a targeting win** — ℓ
contrast δ +0.013 (35k) → +0.092, kernel δ +0.141 → +0.165, θ log q above
random, plus a scary calibration blip (acquired-context kernel KL mean 0.31,
one context at 1.12). All of it prompted a significance check.

**None of it survives.** A paired re-analysis scores both checkpoints on the
*same* `EVAL_SEED`-keyed episodes (episodes are i.i.d., so a single large-N
bootstrap is the correct and complete uncertainty estimate — multiple eval
seeds add nothing, they are the same i.i.d. draws partitioned) and tracks each
paired delta (n2 − 35k) as N grows:

| paired δ (n2 − 35k) | N=512 | N=2048 | N=16384 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ℓ contrast | **+0.079** \*sig\* | +0.007 | −0.003 (n.s.) |
| kernel contrast | +0.024 | +0.030 | +0.007 (n.s.) |
| θ log q margin | +0.011 | −0.001 | −0.001 (n.s.) |
| RMSE@T (ALINE) | +0.007 | −0.009 \*sig\* | −0.002 \*sig\* |
| RMSE gap-to-US | +0.008 | −0.009 \*sig\* | −0.004 \*sig\* |

- **The ℓ-contrast "discovery" was the luck of the 512-episode draw.** At 16k
  both checkpoints sit at ℓ contrast ≈ +0.04 (each individually significant —
  the policy *does* target by goal — but identical between them). Kernel
  contrast and θ-logq margin: both null at 16k.
- **The only surviving cross-checkpoint difference is a ~1% predictive-RMSE
  edge** (n2 0.189 vs 35k 0.192; gap-to-US smaller by 0.004). Flagged
  significant at 16k, but held loosely: its point estimate wandered
  +0.007 → −0.009 → −0.002 with non-overlapping CIs as N grew — the
  heavy-tailed per-episode-MSE signature (squared error / log-density contrasts
  have large outliers; the bootstrap is mildly anti-conservative for them until
  N is large). The *nulls*, by contrast, are consistent across N and tightly
  bounded — those are robust.
- **The calibration scare was also a draw artifact.** Re-run with a fresh
  oracle draw, n2's acquired-context kernel KL is 0.001–0.12 (the earlier "ep0
  1.12" was that particular context). Calibration held through the joint
  fine-tune, as at 35k.

**Robust ALINE-vs-baseline facts (both checkpoints, tight 16k CIs):** ALINE
beats random on θ log q (+0.04); **US still edges ALINE on predictive RMSE**
(gap +0.010–0.013, significant). The latter **walks back the 35k entry's
"within noise of uncertainty sampling on RMSE"** — that 0.005 gap was a
512-episode artifact too; the real gap is small but nonzero.

**Methodological takeaway (the durable part): the default 512-episode eval was
underpowered for the ±0.0x effects this extension measures.** The 5k-entry
correction ("128 under-powered → 512") understated it: 512 point estimates are
themselves unstable to the eval-set draw. **Action taken:** `--eval-episodes`
default 512 → **16384**, processed in `--eval-chunk` (default 2048) rollouts and
pooled, so it fits the 4060; per-chunk seeds are `EVAL_SEED`-keyed so the set is
reproducible and identical across checkpoints. The oracle-calibration draw is
decoupled from the pooled N (a small dedicated batch). For
`eval_episodes <= eval_chunk` (e.g. the smoke run's 16) it is one chunk at the
original offsets — bit-identical to the pre-chunking single-batch eval. The
chunked `evaluate` was verified to reproduce the standalone harness digit-for-
digit at 16k.

**Outcome:** n2 is **not promoted** — the served checkpoint stays the 35k
`artifacts/gp1d_aline.pt`; n2 is retained separately as `gp1d_aline_n2.pt`. The
paired-bootstrap harness is kept at `extensions/aline/scripts/analyze_n2.py`.

**Next (DONE 2026-06-14 — see the entry above): n=2 from the base ACE
checkpoint, not the n=1 policy.** The above fine-tune warm-started from the n=1-converged 35k policy at
a deliberately gentle `--policy-lr 1e-4`, so it may have been trapped in the n=1
basin rather than finding a distinct n=2 optimum — the nulls would then reflect
"couldn't move," not "nothing to find." The clean test trains n=2 from the base
GP-1D ACE checkpoint at the full recipe/budget:

```
extensions/aline/gp1d_aline.py --base-checkpoint artifacts/gp1d.pt \
    --credit-n 2 --steps 35000 --save-checkpoint artifacts/gp1d_aline_n2_frombase.pt
```

(defaults otherwise: policy-lr 3e-4, no special warmup — match the 35k recipe).
**It is controlled for free:** the existing 35k *is* the from-base, n=1,
full-recipe baseline (warm-started from `gp1d.pt`, immediate rewards =
`--credit-n 1`, defaults throughout), so this needs no new control — compare the
two directly under the new 16k eval. Cost ~8–9 h. Caveat to keep in mind: the
matched within-checkpoint contrasts (35k and n2 both ℓ ≈ +0.04, kernel ≈ +0.12)
hint the ceiling may be the task (GP-1D coverage pins ℓ regardless), not the
basin — in which case from-base n=2 will plateau in the same place. Optional
cheaper probe first: a 10–15k from-base run to see whether the contrasts even
*start* to diverge from the n=1 trajectory before committing the full budget.

---

## 2026-06-13 — n-step credit knob (`--credit-n`) implemented

The `--credit-n` knob queued in the PG-credit-assignment entry below is now
wired into `rollout` and the CLI — a one-line generalization of the `weights`
computation. log pi_t is weighted by the sum of the next n rewards,
`weights[:, j] = sum_{k=j}^{j+n-1} R_k = rtg[:, j] − rtg[:, j+n]` (the
reward-to-go shifted left by n):

- `--credit-n 1` (default) = immediate reward only (myopic) — **bit-identical**
  to the previous `reward_mat` path, so existing runs reproduce.
- `--credit-n >= episode-steps` or `<= 0` = full reward-to-go — **bit-identical**
  to the previous `--reward-to-go` path.
- `1 < n < episode-steps` = the n-step window in between (anticipatory credit
  grows with n).

`--reward-to-go` is retained as the full-RTG alias (== `--credit-n 0`); if
combined with an explicit `--credit-n` it overrides it (with a printed note).
The change is confined to the PG *weighting* — the reward signal, the φ/ψ
gradient firewall, and the bitwise inference-path parity guard are all
untouched. Verified: a standalone check confirms n=1 == immediate (bit-equal),
n>=T/<=0 == reward-to-go (bit-equal), and 1<n<T matches a brute-force windowed
sum to float precision (the windowed branch differences two cumsums, so it is
exact only up to rounding — the two endpoints are bit-equal); short
`--credit-n 2` and `--reward-to-go` runs complete end-to-end with finite PG
losses.

This makes the myopic-pretrain → nonmyopic-fine-tune curriculum a one-flag
experiment from the 35k endpoint: `--load-checkpoint artifacts/gp1d_aline.pt
--credit-n 2` (or `--reward-to-go`), ideally with a lowered `--policy-lr` and a
myopic control for the same step budget (see the feasibility discussion). The
fallback ladder's "n-step (n=2–4)" rung is now executable.

Known limitation: like `--reward-to-go` before it, `--credit-n` is **not**
restored on `--resume` — it is read fresh from args and is absent from the
phase-schedule mismatch-warning list (it does not affect the LR/phase schedule),
so a resumed credit run must re-pass the flag or it silently reverts to
immediate (n=1). The primary use here is `--load-checkpoint` (a fresh-optimizer
warm-start fine-tune), which is unaffected; the footgun is only for interrupted
`--resume` continuations.

## 2026-06-13 — 35k run: undertraining confirmed; US gap closed; calibration improved; 128-ep eval was under-powered

Longer fine-tune from the retained GP-1D 200k checkpoint, the pre-registered
fallback #1 (longer run first, same recipe, one change). 35k episode batches
(≈17.5k policy updates under 1:1 alternation), defaults throughout (B=64, pool
128, M=32, T=16, `--random-frac 0.5`, batch-mean baseline, immediate rewards),
avg 0.90 s/step on the RTX 4060 (~8.8 h). Evaluated at `--eval-episodes 512`
(see the methodological note below for why this matters). Log:
`artifacts/gp1d_aline_35k.log`; artifact `artifacts/gp1d_aline_35k.pt` + figure.
The 5k checkpoint was re-evaluated at 512 for a matched comparison
(`artifacts/gp1d_aline_5k_eval512.log`).

Matched comparison (both eval=512, same episode draws):

| metric | 5k | 35k |
| --- | --- | --- |
| RMSE@T — ALINE | 0.209 | 0.187 |
| RMSE@T — US | 0.181 | 0.182 |
| gap to US | 0.028 | 0.005 |
| kernel contrast δ | +0.085 | +0.141 |
| ℓ contrast δ | −0.049 | +0.013 |
| θ log q — ALINE / random | −0.220 / −0.187 | −0.157 / −0.152 |
| mean kernel KL (calibration, 4 acquired contexts) | 0.415 | 0.073 |

- **Undertraining was the dominant factor, as pre-registered.** The US gap
  closed from 0.028 to 0.005 (matched) — ALINE now sits within noise of
  uncertainty sampling on predictive RMSE. Per-step rewards climbed +0.074 →
  ~+0.10 and plateaued around step ~28k (peak +0.108); training NLL still
  drifting down slowly (~0 → −0.2). Reads as approaching convergence on the
  policy side, so the credit-assignment ladder (previous entry) is now an
  *enhancement* path, not a rescue.
- **Kernel targeting contrast is real and grew** (+0.085 → +0.141). The 35k
  policy places queries by goal *and* buys measurable log q(kernel|D_T). The ℓ
  contrast stays weak (−0.049 → +0.013), exactly the recorded task-structure
  hypothesis: coverage queries pin ℓ regardless, so the matched/mismatched gap
  is intrinsically small for ℓ in GP-1D. Kernel was the fairer instrument and
  it delivered.
- **Calibration IMPROVED through the joint fine-tune — reverses an
  in-progress concern.** On the same four acquired contexts, mean kernel KL
  dropped 0.415 → 0.073, driven by ep0 going from a catastrophic 1.523 to
  0.128. The two 35k episodes that looked elevated mid-analysis (0.128, 0.142)
  are far better than the 5k model on those same functions. The 50/50
  policy/random rollout mix held calibration; `--freeze-base` again not needed.
  **The pre-registered 0.002–0.03 KL band was set from undersampled 5k=128
  readings and is not a meaningful floor; future runs should judge calibration
  at eval=512.**
- **Methodological correction: the 5k entry's 128-episode eval was
  under-powered, and two of its headline numbers do not survive at 512.** That
  entry recorded a *null* kernel contrast (−0.006) and θ log q *above* random
  (−0.124 vs −0.147). Re-evaluating the *same 5k checkpoint* at 512 gives
  kernel contrast **+0.085** (positive all along, masked by 128-ep noise) and
  θ log q **below** random (−0.220 vs −0.187 — the claimed advantage was
  sampling noise). The ±0.0x effects this extension measures need ≥512
  episodes; treat the 128-ep numbers in the 5k entry as superseded. **Action:
  bump the `--eval-episodes` default (currently 128) to 512.**
- **θ log q (aggregate) shows no clear ALINE advantage at either budget** (35k:
  −0.157 vs random −0.152, tied). Consistent with task structure — parameter
  inference here is coverage-driven, and random gives coverage too. The signal
  that *does* separate by goal is the kernel contrast, not aggregate θ log q.
- Reward tails bounded as before (pred mean +0.14, −1.76 to +2.44); noiseless
  DGP, `--sigma-obs` stayed 0.
- **Lost: the per-budget trajectory.** The intended 10k/20k/30k checkpoint
  snapshots were not captured (the helper copier failed silently; `--ckpt-every`
  overwrites one file and the final save is model-only), so RMSE-gap-vs-budget
  and contrast-vs-budget are unavailable. The reward/NLL trajectory in the log
  (every 100 steps) carries the convergence read instead, which is what the
  fallback decision actually needed. If trajectory data is wanted later, re-run
  with explicit per-snapshot `--save-checkpoint` names.

**Done same day** (2026-06-13): the 35k artifact is now the canonical
`artifacts/gp1d_aline.pt` the playground tab serves; the 5k model is
preserved as `artifacts/gp1d_aline_5k.pt`. Swap followed the staleness
discipline — re-exported the fp16 blob and regenerated the parity/env/demo
fixtures *together*, then `npm test` green (37/37, incl. ALINE env + policy +
teacher-forced chain parity). The tab was then wired into the public deploy:
`gp1d_aline` added to `pages.yml`'s copy + both validation lists (six models
total), the fp16 blob pushed to the weights repo, and the `aline` branch merged
to `main` via PR #3 — so the tab is no longer local-only. Also done:
`--eval-episodes` default raised 128 → 512 (the under-power finding above).

---

## 2026-06-12 — PG credit assignment: reward-to-go analyzed, n-step credit queued

Discussion record, no code change yet (the 35k budget run is in flight; this
entry pre-registers what to try if its endpoint says "go non-myopic": rewards
plateaued, US still ahead on prediction). The default PG weighting pairs
`log pi_t` with the *immediate* reward `R_t` (Eq. 11 as implemented) — myopic
credit: a query that buys little now but sets up an informative follow-up gets
no credit for the downstream gain. Non-myopic acquisition is much of ALINE's
point, so this is the natural next axis after budget.

- **Telescoping makes reward-to-go gentler than generic REINFORCE.** Because
  `R_t = log q_t − log q_{t−1}`, the reward-to-go collapses to
  `G_t = log q_T − log q_{t−1}` — i.e. terminal-reward REINFORCE with the
  model's own pre-action log q as a built-in, action-independent
  potential-style baseline. The extra variance comes from `log q_T`'s
  dependence on the downstream sampled actions, not from summing T noisy
  increments.
- **Remaining issues with full reward-to-go.** (1) Within-episode credit
  diffusion: all T actions share `log q_T`; what discriminates them is only the
  `log q_{t−1}` subtraction plus cross-episode averaging — weakest exactly at
  the early, most non-myopic steps. (2) Advantage scale grows from per-step
  ~0.1 to remaining-episode ~1–2 at early steps; `--policy-lr`/grad-clip were
  implicitly validated at immediate-reward scale, so watch the pg trace and be
  ready to lower the policy LR — otherwise "reward-to-go is unstable" and
  "wrong LR" are confounded. (3) Every step's credit routes through the
  terminal self-estimate at context size 17, the edge of the warm start's
  trained `n_context ≤ 20` range — the oracle calibration guard becomes more
  load-bearing. (4) It departs from Eq. 11's immediate-reward form; record as
  a deliberate variant if flipped on.
- **n-step credit is the middle ground to try first**:
  `G_t^(n) = log q_{min(t−1+n, T)} − log q_{t−1}`, with n=1 the current
  immediate scheme and n=T full reward-to-go. Small n (2–4) captures two-query
  coordination — the tight-local-pairs strategy that lengthscale/kernel
  identification wants — at a fraction of the variance. The 5k eyeball notes
  already showed beside-acquired-point clustering under xi=ell, consistent
  with myopic credit learning the *reactive* half of pairing (the second
  query's payoff is immediate); what n >= 2 adds is *anticipatory* placement.
  Implementation: a small generalization of the `weights` computation in
  `rollout` (a `--credit-n` knob subsuming `--reward-to-go`).
- **Fallback ladder refined** (supersedes the 5k entry's order): longer run
  (in flight) → n-step credit (n=2–4) → full reward-to-go → per-layer cache
  reads. Footnote for completeness: the batch-mean baseline includes each
  episode's own reward — a standard O(1/B) bias, negligible at B=64;
  unaffected by any of this.

## 2026-06-12 — Playground tab (TS port; local-only against the 5k artifact)

The playground gained a sixth tab running this extension in-browser (plan +
verification: `docs/plans/PLAN-aline-playground.md`). Interaction model: a
hidden GP function — sampled client-side by an exact float64 port of the gp1d
DGP — answers every query; the user only chooses *where* to sample, with the
policy's π(x | D, ξ) rendered as advice next to an uncertainty-sampling
marker; "Follow policy" unrolls the episode; the goal selector is live,
including mid-episode switches. Local-only: not in the deploy workflow; the
5k validation checkpoint serves it until the longer fine-tune lands (swap =
re-run export + parity together).

Recorded TS deviations / equivalences (all parity-pinned):

- **Final-state reads come from the inherited TS forward**, not a re-run
  block loop: the base port already returns per-layer stacks, so
  `forwardWithStates` is `ctxLayers[L-1]` plus `final_norm` re-applied to
  `tgtLayers[L-1]` — the exact values Python's `forward_with_states` returns
  (the policy fixture asserts the states directly).
- **Omission replaces masking, exactly.** Target tokens never attend to each
  other and candidates are scored pointwise, so the TS side builds only the
  active goal tokens and only the available candidates; ξ is "which target
  rows exist", and the policy reads a goal-row *slice* of one shared forward
  that also carries band, all-three-latent, and US-candidate rows (row
  independence makes the extra rows invisible; the all-three-latent rows are
  a tab refinement so marginals and a ξ-independent log q(θ_true) metric
  survive goal switches).
- **The chain fixture is teacher-forced**: the TS test replays Python's
  recorded argmax actions and asserts logits/log-probs, so an fp near-tie
  cannot flip an action and fail the build (agreement is reported instead).
- **The env's RNG streams are not parity-matched** (mulberry32 vs torch);
  the fixtures pin the deterministic math (K, Cholesky) instead, and the
  teacher-forced chain carries Python-drawn values.

Eyeball notes on the 5k policy (honest reading, not a gate): the loop works
end-to-end at ~150–200 ms/step (Edge, this workstation); log q(θ_true) and
RMSE improve over an episode; and goal-dependent placement is *visible* —
under ξ = ℓ the policy concentrates its mass immediately beside already-
acquired points (the tight-local-pairs strategy lengthscale information
wants), clearly separated from the uncertainty-sampling pick, while under
ξ = predictive it spreads toward coverage. Consistent with the 5k evaluation:
placement differs by goal even though the measured log-q contrasts are still
null at this budget. The tab's didactics were not tuned to this checkpoint.

## 2026-06-12 — 5k validation run: the policy learns; US gap and null ℓ-contrast

First validation fine-tune from the retained GP-1D 200k checkpoint: 5k episode
batches (≈2.5k policy updates under 1:1 alternation), defaults throughout
(B=64, pool 128, M=32, T=16, `--random-frac 0.5`, batch-mean baseline,
immediate rewards), avg 1.02 s/step on the RTX 4060. Full log:
`artifacts/gp1d_aline_5k.log`; artifact `artifacts/gp1d_aline.pt` + figure.

- **The policy learns.** Held-out predictive RMSE 0.220 vs random 0.248 (below
  along the whole curve); θ log q −0.124 vs random −0.147 (above from ~step 4).
  Per-step rewards climbed throughout training (+0.074 → ~+0.10) and were still
  rising at step 5000.
- **`q_φ` calibration survived the joint fine-tune.** On policy-acquired
  contexts, hyperparameter marginals track the grid oracle (kernel KL
  0.002–0.025; means close; stds somewhat conservative — widest on the fixed
  periodic demo case, where the ℓ-goal policy clusters queries). This is the
  50/50 policy/random rollout mix in prediction steps doing its job; the
  `--freeze-base` escape hatch was not needed.
- **Uncertainty sampling still wins on prediction** (US 0.194): ALINE tracks US
  until ~step 8, then a gap opens. Read as **undertraining**, not a capacity
  verdict — 2.5k policy updates is <1% of the paper's episode count, training
  NLL was still improving (−0.4 by the end), and rewards hadn't plateaued. The
  pre-registered fallback order stands: longer run first (same recipe, one
  change at a time), then `--reward-to-go`, then per-layer cache reads.
- **Targeting contrast is null** (log q(ℓ_true | D_T): matched −0.043 vs
  mismatched −0.042). Beyond undertraining, an honest task-structure hypothesis:
  in GP-1D, coverage queries that help prediction also pin down the
  lengthscale, so the matched/mismatched gap may be intrinsically small for ℓ —
  the paper demonstrated the contrast on the psychometric task (threshold-region
  vs extreme stimuli), not on its GP experiment. Query *placement* does differ
  by goal in the demo panel; it just doesn't yet buy measurable log q. A
  **kernel-goal contrast** would be a fairer instrument (kernel identification
  wants tight local pairs to read roughness; prediction wants coverage) — an
  eval-only change, queued as fallback #4. *Implemented same day*: `evaluate`
  now reports both instruments (acquire under ξ={kernel} vs ξ=pred on identical
  episodes, score `log q(kernel_true | D_T)` through the categorical head). On
  the 5k model the kernel contrast is **also null** (matched −0.272 vs
  mismatched −0.266, δ = −0.006; all other metrics reproduce digit-for-digit),
  so at this budget the missing contrast is not instrument-specific —
  consistent with undertraining being the dominant factor, with the
  task-structure hypothesis still open for ℓ specifically.
- Reward tails bounded as predicted under the noiseless DGP (pred: −0.9 to
  +1.8, mean +0.14); `--sigma-obs` stays at 0.

## 2026-06-12 — Initial implementation: ALINE as an ACE-native extension

Implemented per `docs/plans/PLAN-aline.md` (design discussion resolved
2026-06-12; three-reviewer doublechecks on both the plan and the code).
`aline.py` is task-agnostic (knows `ace.py`, not `gp1d.py`); the GP-1D episodes,
RL loop, and diagnostics live in `gp1d_aline.py`.

### The thesis: the paper's apparatus collapses into token composition

- **The inference network IS the core `ACE`, unchanged.** Parameter targets are
  latent QUERY tokens; predictive targets are data QUERY tokens; the paper's
  target specifier ξ is *which target tokens are active* — a per-row mask over
  a fixed superset `[ℓ_ell, ℓ_scale, ℓ_kernel, x*_1..M]`. The target tokens do
  double duty: they are the queries `q_φ` answers (NLL and reward are computed
  on them) and, through their final states, the goal representation the policy
  reads — including how uncertain the model still is about each goal.
- **Query candidates are "hypothetical targets":** data QUERY tokens at
  candidate locations, embedded by the core embedder verbatim. ξ-switching at
  runtime (and the paper's D.4 demos) reduce to mask flips.
- `p(ξ)`: 50% predictive / 50% parameter rows, the parameter subset drawn by
  `sample_reveal_mask(3, b, q=0.0)` — the tested non-empty subset/count
  mixture, so singletons, pairs, and all-three are in-distribution. The
  discrete `kernel` as a parameter target is a small genuine extension over the
  paper's continuous-only GP experiment (house rule: exercise the categorical
  path).

### Architecture: read-only policy decoder, structural φ/ψ separation

- Two `PolicyBlock`s (pre-LN: query→context cross-attn, query→target
  cross-attn, MLP; ~0.4M params on the 1.2M base) read the **detached** final
  trunk states; a linear head scores candidates pointwise; masked softmax over
  the remaining pool. No query–query self-attention and no write-back — both
  match the released reference implementation (`model/encoder.py:create_mask`
  unmasks only `[:, :context]` plus query→ξ-selected-target columns; its
  Fig. A1(a) rendering contradicts its own code). The reference is literally a
  read-only query/target stream over per-layer context states with shared
  weights, which confirms the hoisting equivalence: per-layer interleaving
  without write-back ≡ this decoder reading per-layer caches. The two
  deliberate differences: **separate policy weights** (what makes the φ/ψ
  gradient firewall structural — the paper's "PG does not update q_φ" made
  exact: no-grad query embedding, detached states) and **final-state reads**
  (the per-layer-cache upgrade path is a config change, pre-registered as the
  first fallback if the policy plateaus below US).
- **Permanent bitwise parity invariant:** `forward_with_states` re-runs the
  core block loop verbatim, and `check_step0` asserts predictions equal a fresh
  base `ACE` bitwise — at warm start and in tests. The inference path of a
  trained ALINE artifact is exactly an ACE, so `gp1d.evaluate`/`gp_oracle`
  diagnostics apply unchanged. If `ace.py`'s forward changes, the warm start
  fails loudly (arbuffer's coupling guard, strengthened from step-0-only to
  always).

### Training: alternating phases, episode-batch updates

- **Alternating schedule (deliberate variant of Algorithm 1).** The paper
  applies `L_NLL + L_PG` together at every inner update, with warm-up (random
  actions, NLL-only) its only pure phase. Here, steps alternate *prediction*
  (NLL → φ; policy frozen; rollouts 50% current-policy / 50% random) and
  *policy* (REINFORCE → ψ; φ frozen) — each phase optimizes against a
  stationary partner. The 50/50 rollout mix is the calibration-retention
  device: on-policy rows adapt `q_φ` to policy-shaped contexts (Prop. 2's KL
  gap = reward-bound tightness), random rows preserve the random-context
  calibration that keeps the oracle diagnostics meaningful. The paper-literal
  scheme is kept as `--update-mode simultaneous`. Warm-up is just a
  prediction-only prefix (`--warmup-pred-steps`: 0 with a warm start — the
  fresh policy head is near-uniform — 2000 from scratch).
- **One optimizer step per episode batch (deviation from Algorithm 1's in-loop
  updates).** Within a rollout the parameters are frozen, so the reward
  `R_t = mean_active(Δ log q)` measures information from the new point, not
  optimizer movement (reward purity); it also keeps the repo's training spine —
  each episode batch is a pure function of `(seed, step)` via the `mix_seed`
  reseed, policy sampling included, giving max|dW|=0 reproducibility and
  resume-exactness. NLL (Eq. 12) backwards per step so trunk graphs free; the
  PG loss (Eq. 11, γ=1, immediate rewards, batch-mean baseline; rewards
  telescope to the total improvement, `--reward-to-go` is the unbiased-credit
  variant, off by default) backwards once at episode end — only the small
  policy-side graphs are retained. Two Adam optimizers, per-group cosine
  schedules with `T_max` = each group's expected optimizer-step count.
- Episodes: one `gp1d.draw_instances` call at pool+M points per batch (pool
  observations are lookups), 1 random seed point, T=16 default (context ≤ 17,
  inside the warm start's trained `n_context ≤ 20`; warn past 19), noiseless
  (`--sigma-obs` at lookup is the knob; MDN `min_scale` bounds the densities,
  and the 5k run confirmed unremarkable reward tails). Argmax actions at
  evaluation (deterministic fixed diagnostics), sampling during training.

### Recorded hazards (found during implementation/review)

- **Autograd version counter vs deferred PG backward:** `observe` must replace
  `query.mask` *functionally* — the pending policy graphs hold references to
  earlier masks; in-place `scatter_` corrupts them.
- **Cosine LR multiplier is exactly 0 on a run's final step** (core
  `_build_scheduler` convention): harmless for real runs, but 1-step test runs
  train at LR 0.
- **Resume restores the phase schedule from the checkpoint's `config`**
  (`warmup_pred_steps`; warns on `update_mode`/`freeze_base`/`random_frac`
  mismatch) — re-deriving the CLI default would silently switch a resumed
  from-scratch run to alternation.
- **PG normalization uses the effective on-policy episode count**, not the
  batch size — a plain batch mean halves the policy gradient under
  `simultaneous` + `random_frac`.

### Deferred / future

- ALINE + ACEP runtime Beta priors (the paper's own stated future work; the
  co-location makes `ace_prior_beta.py` available nearly for free).
- Per-layer cache reads for the policy (the reference's read pattern).
- Second experiment family (psychometric / BED) = the pre-agreed graduation
  trigger to a separate nanoALINE repo, not this extension.
