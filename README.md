# nanoACE

nanoACE is a small, readable implementation of the core ideas behind the
Amortized Conditioning Engine (ACE): treat data, interpretable latents, and
runtime prior information as tokens; condition on one token set; predict
distributions over another token set.

The goal is legible source that a human or coding agent can read end to end and
extend. It is not a packaged ACE runtime, not a benchmark suite, and not a clone
of the original research code.

## Current Status

Implemented modules:

- [ace.py](ace.py): core `Variable`, `Tokens`, `Batch`, bounded-latent
  coordinate helpers, ACE transformer, shared continuous MDN head, shared masked
  categorical head, prediction object, loss, and autoregressive sampling helper.
- [gaussian_toy.py](gaussian_toy.py): Gaussian ACEP toy with two bounded
  continuous latents, runtime Beta information tokens, online
  training/evaluation CLI, analytic grid posterior, posterior predictive,
  checkpoint helpers, and plotting.
- [gp1d.py](gp1d.py): GP-1D regression example with continuous kernel
  hyperparameter latents, discrete kernel selection, online CPU float64 GP
  sampling, numerical grid posterior oracle, and a fixed diagnostic plot.
- [diagnostics.py](diagnostics.py): reusable grid-query helpers for marginal and
  two-variable AR diagnostics.
- [playground/](playground/): a **non-core**, fully in-browser TypeScript demo
  (separate toolchain) where trained models run client-side — GP-1D and Gaussian,
  with interactive conditioning, latent pinning, and an analytic oracle overlay.
  See [playground/README.md](playground/README.md). The Python core stays
  torch-only; the playground is an example built on a parity-tested TS port of
  `ace.py`'s forward pass.
- [DEVLOG.md](DEVLOG.md): design decisions and rationale. Read this before
  changing architecture or scope.

Next work: use the GP-1D oracle to decide whether the current sampler, model
size, or training objective needs adjustment before adding more examples.

## Setup

Use a local virtual environment. The current requirements pin the PyTorch CUDA
wheel that has been tested on this workstation:

- `torch==2.11.0+cu128`
- PyTorch CUDA runtime 12.8
- NVIDIA RTX 4060 Laptop GPU

PowerShell:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the Gaussian example:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe gaussian_toy.py
```

The Gaussian example trains online with runtime Beta priors over `mu` and
`log_sigma`, prints posterior moment diagnostics against the matching analytic
oracle, and saves a plot to `artifacts/gaussian_toy.png` by default. The fixed
diagnostic plot overlays the runtime prior, oracle posterior, and ACE posterior
on the latent marginal panels.
For comparability, evaluation always uses the same deterministic batch: three
observed `y` values, plus the sampled `mu` and `log_sigma` used only for printed
diagnostics. The constants live in [gaussian_toy.py](gaussian_toy.py), so rerunning the
same checkpoint regenerates the same plotted case.
The plot also compares the posterior predictive density for a new `y`; the
analytic predictive is computed by marginalizing over the posterior grid, not by
plugging posterior moments into a Gaussian.
Training sometimes reveals one latent as a zero-spread information token and
asks for the other, so the autoregressive diagnostic is trained on the
conditional latent queries it uses at evaluation time. The fixed diagnostic
uses `EVAL_MU_PRIOR = (0.70, 20.0)` and
`EVAL_LOGSIG_PRIOR = (0.70, 8.0)` in unit-mean/concentration coordinates.

Useful Gaussian controls:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe gaussian_toy.py --latent-context-prob 0.25
```

Common artifact names used by the Gaussian example:

- `artifacts/gaussian_toy.pt`
- `artifacts/gaussian_toy.png`

Regenerate the longer-run diagnostic and checkpoint pair:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe gaussian_toy.py --steps 10000 --save-checkpoint artifacts\gaussian_toy.pt --plot-path artifacts\gaussian_toy.png
```

For a short run that verifies the script starts and completes:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe gaussian_toy.py --steps 20 --batch-size 32
```

To force CPU:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe gaussian_toy.py --device cpu --steps 20
```

Save and reuse a small Gaussian checkpoint:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe gaussian_toy.py --save-checkpoint artifacts/gaussian_toy.pt
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe gaussian_toy.py --eval-only --load-checkpoint artifacts/gaussian_toy.pt
```

Run the GP-1D example:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe gp1d.py
```

The GP-1D example trains on functions sampled online from four kernels: RBF,
Matern-1/2, Matern-3/2, and periodic. Its diagnostic computes a numerical grid
oracle for the fixed context: it scores every kernel and
`log_lengthscale`/`log_outputscale` grid point by the GP marginal likelihood,
normalizes those quadrature weights, and reports the resulting kernel posterior,
continuous latent marginals, and posterior predictive moments. The predictive
oracle is the mixture of conditional GP predictives over the posterior grid, not
a single GP at plugged-in hyperparameter means. The fixed diagnostic uses
irregular, clustered context locations so nearby observations can reveal local
roughness; evenly spaced sparse points made kernel and lengthscale inference
mostly uninformative.

Common artifact names used by the GP-1D example:

- `artifacts/gp1d.pt`
- `artifacts/gp1d.png`

For a short GP-1D run:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe gp1d.py --steps 20 --batch-size 16
```

Reuse a saved GP-1D checkpoint and regenerate the oracle comparison plot:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe gp1d.py --eval-only --load-checkpoint artifacts\gp1d.pt --plot-path artifacts\gp1d.png
```

## Design Notes

nanoACE keeps the ACE conditioning semantics, but the paper math is a starting
point rather than a constraint. The invariants are:

- variables are tokens;
- data values, latent values, and latent priors can appear in context;
- target tokens request predictive distributions;
- the training path is type-agnostic through `dist.log_prob`;
- the model uses separated context self-attention and target-to-context
  cross-attention.

The internal token representation is intentionally explicit. Data values stay in
task coordinates. Bounded continuous latent values are encoded to internal
`[-1, 1]` coordinates at token boundaries; native-coordinate prediction helpers
on `Predictions` decode means/variances/samples and add the affine density
Jacobian when needed.

```python
Batch(
    variables: list[Variable],
    context: Tokens,
    target: Tokens,
)

Tokens(
    var_id: LongTensor[B, T],
    x: FloatTensor[B, T, x_dim],
    value: FloatTensor[B, T],
    value_index: LongTensor[B, T],
    prior: FloatTensor[B, T, 2],   # bounded latent info: mean, spread
    mode: LongTensor[B, T],   # VALUE | PRIOR | QUERY
    mask: BoolTensor[B, T],
)
```

## Agent Notes

Before making architectural changes, read [DEVLOG.md](DEVLOG.md). The project
values local, readable code over benchmark machinery. In particular:

- keep `ace.py` as the main readable implementation file;
- if a gitignored `temp/` directory is present, treat it as archived external
  experiment code and copy ideas only when they clearly fit this repository;
- keep examples small and diagnostic;
- prefer changing the implementation when a simpler or more robust tweak serves
  ACE's conditioning interface better than paper fidelity.

Generated directories such as `.venv/`, `__pycache__/`, `temp/`, and
`artifacts/` are ignored.
